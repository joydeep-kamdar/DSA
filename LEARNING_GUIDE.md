## 🚀 How to Use This Learning Path

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Read the Program**
   - Open the source file (e.g., `src/NodeBasics.java`)
   - Read all comments carefully - they explain concepts
   - Study the algorithm explanations

2. **Run the Program**
   ```bash
   javac -d . src/ProgramName.java
   java ProgramName
   ```
   - Observe the output
   - Understand what each demo shows

3. **Run the Tests**
   ```bash
   ./run-tests.sh ProgramNameTest
   ```
   - See all tests pass (green checkmarks)
   - Read the test code to understand verification

4. **Experiment**
   - Modify the main() method
   - Try different inputs
   - Break things to see what happens!
   - Add your own test cases

5. **Practice**
   - Implement methods without looking
   - Draw the linked list on paper
   - Trace through the code step by step

## 📖 Key Concepts Covered

### Fundamental Concepts
✓ Nodes as building blocks
✓ References and pointers
✓ Head and tail pointers
✓ Null handling and edge cases

### Time Complexity Analysis
✓ O(1) operations: addFirst, removeFirst
✓ O(n) operations: traversal, search
✓ Understanding when operations are fast vs slow

### Data Structure Types
✓ Singly LinkedList: One direction, less memory
✓ Doubly LinkedList: Bidirectional, more flexibility
✓ When to use each type

### Classic Algorithms
✓ Finding middle element (fast/slow pointers)
✓ Cycle detection (Floyd's algorithm)
✓ Removing duplicates
✓ Reversing a list

### Practical Skills
✓ Writing generic data structures
✓ Handling edge cases
✓ Testing with JUnit
✓ Comparing data structures

## 🎓 CS2100 Exam Prep

### Common Exam Topics Covered

1. **Write LinkedList methods from scratch**
   - Practice: Programs 3-11

2. **Analyze time complexity**
   - See comments in every program
   - Review Program 17

3. **Trace through operations**
   - Draw pictures of each step
   - Use the printList() methods

4. **Compare data structures**
   - Program 17 has complete comparison
   - Understand trade-offs

5. **Debug LinkedList code**
   - Common bugs covered in comments
   - Edge cases tested

### Practice Problems

Try implementing these yourself:
- [ ] Find nth node from end
- [ ] Merge two sorted lists
- [ ] Check if list is palindrome
- [ ] Remove nth node from end
- [ ] Detect and remove cycle

## 🛠️ Testing Your Understanding

After completing all programs, you should be able to:

- [ ] Draw a linked list on paper showing nodes and pointers
- [ ] Implement addFirst() from memory
- [ ] Implement removeFirst() from memory
- [ ] Explain why get(index) is O(n) for LinkedList
- [ ] Explain when to use ArrayList vs LinkedList
- [ ] Write a method to find the middle element
- [ ] Implement a stack using LinkedList
- [ ] Understand doubly linked list advantages
- [ ] Analyze time complexity of any LinkedList operation
- [ ] Debug LinkedList code with null pointer issues

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Draw Pictures**: Always draw the list before and after operations
2. **Start Simple**: Don't skip to advanced programs
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty list, single element, large lists
4. **Use the Debugger**: Step through code line by line
5. **Explain Out Loud**: Teach concepts to rubber duck or friend
6. **Practice Regularly**: 30 minutes daily beats 5 hours once
7. **Read Test Code**: Tests show how methods should work
8. **Compare to ArrayList**: Understand the differences
